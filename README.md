# Julian's Editor 0.8 Decompilation

Welcome to the decompilation project of **Julian's Editor** version 0.8! This is a work in progress, and the files are pulled directly from the decompiled sources‚Äîthey definitely need some cleaning up.

> **Note:** These are JAR files from a compiled Cocos2D game. The code is messy and not immediately usable, but with some effort, we can make it shine.

## üì• Sources

The files were obtained from:

- [Discord Message](https://discord.com/channels/885486563952312330/887960776973877248/1085045254228545557)
- [Archive.org](https://archive.org/details/julianseditor-0.8) (archine by me)

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PuzzlingGGG/julains-editor-0-8.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd julains-editor-0-8
   ```

3. **Open the files with your favorite IDE and start tinkering!**

## ü§î Why This Project?

I started this decompilation to explore the inner workings of Julian's Editor and to possibly enhance or learn from its code. It's a bit of a puzzle, and any help is appreciated!
